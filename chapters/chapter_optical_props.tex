\chapter{Properties of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes}

The properties of carbon nanotubes (CNT) strongly depend on their crystal structure. CNTs consists of carbon atoms bound together via sp$^2$ orbitals ($\sigma$ bonds) and arranged in a honeycomb lattice \cite{soavi2016ultrafast}. Due to the similarities between the crystal structures of graphene and CNTs, different CNT species can be classified using the basis vectors of the graphene lattice \cite{charlier2007electronic}. In fact, the countless ways of rolling up a graphene sheet into a nanotube evince that CNTs can exhibit varying helical geometries and symmetries with respect to their axial direction as shown in Figure \ref{fig:symmetries}.

	\label{fig:symmetries}
\end{figure}

These morphological properties dictate the allowed electronic states by asserting boundary conditions on the electron wavefunction along the circumferential direction \cite{charlier2007electronic}. All allowed electronic states exhibit anisotropic features and obey a set of optical selection rules that govern allowed inter-band transitions. Moreover, the effect of strong electron-electron interactions impose further modifications to the electronic structure and effectively suppress the presence of any free-electron continuum states \cite{ando1997excitons}. This unusual behavior alone distinguishes carbon nanotubes from conventional semiconductors as they typically exhibit relatively weak Coulomb interactions \cite{ando1997excitons}.



\section{Definition of the Chiral Vector $\vec{C_h}$}

Each unique species of carbon nanotubes can be	 denoted using a set of indices ($m$,$n$). These integers $m$ and $n$ define the chiral vector $\vec{C_h }$ expressed as 
\begin{equation}
	\vec{C_h} = n {\vec{a_1}} + m {\vec{a_2}} \equiv (m,n)
	\label{eq:chiral_vec}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{a_1}$ and $\vec{a_2}$ represent the lattice basis vectors of the 2D graphene sheet as shown in Figure \ref{fig:chiral_vectors}. This chiral vector $\vec{C_h}$ yields the nanotube diameter $d_t$ via the expression

\begin{equation}
	d_t = \dfrac{|\vec{C_h}|}{\pi} = \dfrac{a_{C-C}}{\pi}\sqrt{3(m^2 + mn + n^2)},
\end{equation} 

where $a_{C-C} \approx$ \SI{1.44}{\angstrom} defines the nearest-neighbor distance between carbon atoms in graphene \cite{nanot2013single}.

\section{Optical and Electronic Properties}

\subsection{Electronic Band Structure}

Given the similarities between CNTs and graphene, calculating the electronic band structure of graphene is the first step towards determining that of CNTs. A simple tight-binding model can be used to calculate the band structure of graphene. Such a model includes first nearest-neighbor interactions involving the $\pi$-orbitals of two atomic sites located at positions and $\vec{a_1}$ as well as $\vec{a_2}$ \cite{charlier2007electronic}. Here, $\vec{a_1}$ and $\vec{a_2}$ represent the lattice vectors of graphene. Furthermore, a hopping term $\gamma_0 \approx 2.9$ eV  characterizes the interactions between neighboring $\pi$-orbitals \cite{charlier2007electronic}. The Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ for this simple system is then written as 

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{H} = \begin{bmatrix} 
	0 & \alpha(k) \\
	\alpha^*(k) & 0
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha(\vec{k}) = (1 + e^{-i \vec{k}\cdot \vec{a_1}} + e^{-i \vec{k}\cdot \vec{a_2}})$ and $\alpha^*(\vec{k})$ refers to the complex conjugate of $\alpha(\vec{k})$\cite{charlier2007electronic}. In addition, $\vec{k}$ stands for a reciprocal space vector within the first Brillouin zone. Diagonalizing this matrix yields the energy dispersion 

\begin{equation}
	E^{\pm} (k_x, k_y) = \pm \gamma_0 \sqrt{1 + 4 \cos\dfrac{\sqrt{3}k_x a}{2}\cos\dfrac{k_y a}{2} + 4 \cos^2 \dfrac{k_y a}{2}}
	\label{eq:graphene_band}
\end{equation} 

 where $E^-$ and $E^+$ stand for the dispersion relations of the valence and conduction bands respectively. The variables $k_x$ and $k_y$ denote the x- and y-components of $\vec{k}$. Moreover, the constant $a = \sqrt{3}a_{C-C}$, where $a_{C-C} \approx$ \SI{1.44}{\angstrom} and refers to the nearest-neighbor distance between the lattice sites. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/chapter_optical_props/graphene_band_charlier}
	\caption{Electronic band structure of graphene determined using a tight-binding model (dashed line) and through ab-initio calculations (solid line). Reproduced and modified from Ref \cite{reich2002tight}.}
	\label{fig:graphene_band}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:graphene_band} presents a plot of Eq. \ref{eq:graphene_band} as compared with a band structure calculation using ab-initio methods. Despite the disagreement between both approaches, they both predict a linear dispersion in the region near the $K$ position in momentum space \cite{charlier2007electronic}. This region of the band structure is commonly referred to as the Dirac cone	\cite{charlier2007electronic}. Moreover, both models identify graphene as a metal since the valence and conduction bands intersect at $K$ \cite{charlier2007electronic}. In conjunction with the band structure of graphene, the so-called zone-folding approximation yields the band structure of CNTs. 



\subsection{Chiralities of Semiconducting and Metallic Nanotubes}

The zone-folding method asserts that the periodic boundary conditions along the circumferential direction of CNTs dictate the quantization of the allowed $\vec{k}$ vectors in the electronic band structure \cite{charlier2007electronic}. This condition applied to the electron wavefunction $\Psi(\vec{r})$ is expressed as 
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{\vec{k}}(\vec{r} + \vec{C_h}) = e^{i \vec{k} \cdot \vec{C_h}} \Psi_{\vec{k}}(\vec{r}) = \Psi_{\vec{k}}(\vec{r}),
\label{eq:boundary_cond}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{k}$ respectively define vectors in real and reciprocal space on the surface of the CNT \cite{charlier2007electronic}. Furthermore, $\vec{C_h}$ represents the chiral vector defined in Eq. \ref{eq:chiral_vec}. Equation \ref{eq:boundary_cond} reveals that the symmetry of the CNT given by the chirality $\vec{C_h} \equiv (n,m)$ determines the band structure. In addition, the variable $\nu$ defined as 

\begin{equation}
\nu \equiv (n-m) \mathrm{\hspace{1.5mm} mod \hspace{1.5mm}} 3,
\label{eq:nu_cnt}
\end{equation}

is also used to classify the two different band structures can occur. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.36]{images/chapter_optical_props/nine_zero_band_charlier}
	\caption{Band structure and density of states for a (9,0) carbon nanotube derived using the zone-folding scheme. These are plotted in units of $\gamma_0 \approx 2.9$, the tight-binding hopping energy between first nearest-neighbors. Reproduced from \cite{charlier2007electronic}.}
	\label{fig:nine_zero_cnt}
\end{figure}



In the case where $\nu = 0 $, the band structure contains a Dirac cone along with additional sub-bands within the valence and conduction bands as presented in Figure \ref{fig:nine_zero_cnt} . CNTs that satisfy this condition include $(n,n)$ carbon nanotubes, also commonly referred to as ``armchair'' nanotubes, that constitute the set of all metallic (gapless) nanotubes \cite{nanot2012optoelectronic}. Furthermore, $(n,m)$ nanotubes where $n-m = 3j$ ($j > 0$) also satisfy this $\nu = 0$ condition. However, these non-armchair nanotubes ($n\neq m$) exhibit so-called curvature-induced band gaps and behave as narrow-gap semiconductors ($\sim1 - 100$ meV band gap energy) \cite{nanot2012optoelectronic}. 

When $\nu= \pm 1$, the band structure corresponds to that of a medium-gap semiconductor ($\sim0.5 - 1$ eV band gap energy) \cite{nanot2012optoelectronic}. This band structure excludes the presence of a Dirac cone as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ten_zero_cnt}  \cite{charlier2007electronic}.

\subsection{Optical Selection Rules}

Selection rules dictate the optical transitions that can occur. Such optical processes depend upon the conservation of both energy and angular momentum \cite{weismanKonoBook}. The notation E$_{ij}$ denotes an inter-band transition between the valence sub-band $i$ and the conduction sub-band $j$ \cite{weismanKonoBook}. In addition, $\Delta n \equiv i - j$ defines the difference between the band indices $i$ and $j$.  Incident light polarized parallel to carbon nanotube axial direction excites transitions where $\Delta n = 0$ \cite{weismanKonoBook}. This includes transitions such as $E_{11}$, $E_{22}$ and $E_{33}$. Whereas, incident light polarized perpendicular to the nanotube axial direction can only excite optical transitions where $\Delta n = \pm 1$ such as $E_{12}$ \cite{weismanKonoBook}.

\end{figure}


 
\section{The Effects of Electron-Electron Interactions}
\subsection{Supression of the Free-Electron Continuum}
The simple tight-binding picture presented earlier ignores the effects of electron-electron interactions and thereby does not fully account for the effects of quantum confinement \cite{weismanKonoBook}. Indeed, the inclusion of electron-electron interactions into this picture yields a new electronic structure in which free electrons play a minimal role.

Strong electron-electron interactions influence the binding energies of quasi-particles known as excitons that form after the creation of an electron-hole pair \cite{koch2006semiconductor}. Excitons represent hydrogen-like quasi-particles composed of a negatively-charged electron bound to a positively-charged hole \cite{koch2006semiconductor}. In an ideal 1-D material, theory predicts that excitons will have an infinite binding energy \cite{ando2005theory}. This alone foreshadows the dominance of excitons in the optical properties of carbon nanotubes \cite{ando2005theory}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{images/chapter_optical_props/ando_suppression}
	\caption{Optical absorption spectrum of a semiconducting nanotube with (solid line) and without (dashed line) the effect of Coulomb interactions. Arrows mark the band edge positions of free electron continua. Reproduced and modified from Ref \cite{ando2005theory}.}
	\label{fig:ando_suppression}
\end{figure}

The strong quantum confinement of nanotubes effectively suppresses the density of states of any free electron continuum whilst enhancing that of excitonic states. Moreover, the effective strength of Coulomb interactions $S_{e-e}$ can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}
	S_{e-e} \equiv \dfrac{e^2 \kappa L}{2 \pi \gamma/L},
\end{equation}

where $e^2 /\kappa L$ and $2 \pi \gamma / L$ account for the characteristic energy scales associated with Coulomb interactions and the kinetic energy of electrons respectively \cite{ando2005theory}. Here, $e$ defines the charge of an electron, $\gamma$ represents a free parameter, $L$ indicates the nanotube circumference $|\vec{C_h}|$, and $\kappa$ denotes the static dielectric constant used to account for screening effects.

Figure \ref{fig:ando_suppression} shows the calculated optical absorption spectrum of a semiconducting nanotube with and without the presence of Coulomb interactions. The plot shows the presence of Van-Hove singularies when ignoring the effect of Coulomb interactions. After accounting for these interactions, the oscillator strength of the low energy bound states of excitons becomes enhanced and absorption in the free-electron continuum drastically diminishes. The band edge of the free-electron continuum also shifts as a result of Coulomb interactions \cite{ando1997excitons}. Furthermore, this shift of the band edge increases as $S_{e-e}$ increases \cite{ando2005theory}. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[scale=0.62]{images/chapter_optical_props/cnt_absorbance_yota}
	\caption{Absorbance spectrum of a (6,5) carbon nanotube sample at room temperature. Reproduced from Ref \cite{ichinose2017extraction}. }
	\label{fig:cnt_abs_yota}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Exciton Binding Energies}

The binding energies of excitons in CNTs tend to be on the order of hundreds of meV \cite{wang2005optical}. For instance, the excitons of (6,5) nanotubes have a binding of roughly 400 meV \cite{wang2005optical}. At room temperature $k_b T \approx$ 22 meV, meaning that the energy scale associated thermal fluctuations falls short of the exciton binding energies in CNTs. Thus, excitons of CNTs are quite stable at room temperature. Figure \ref{fig:cnt_abs_yota} illustrates this effect as the room-temperature absorbance spectrum of a (6,5) sample exhibits well-defined, excitonic resonances. 

In contrast, conventional semiconductors such as GaAs only exhibit excitons with binding energies typically less than 20 meV \cite{liang1970excitons}.  As a result, these materials have to be cooled down to low temperatures in order to easily observe exciton resonances as shown in Figure \ref{fig:gaas_vs_cnt_absorbance}.

\end{figure}



\section{Summary}

Carbon nanotubes exhibit unique properties. They behave as either semiconducting or metallic materials depending on their chirality $(m,n)$. Furthermore, their 1-D character establishes anisotropic optical selection rules depending on the polarization of light with respect to the carbon nanotube axial direction. Moreover, the quantum confinement imposed by their 1-D structure enhances electron-electron interactions that mitigate the oscillator strength of free-electron states in the electronic band structure. These strong Coulomb interactions promote the presence of excitons with very high binding energies that are stable even at room temperatures, unlike those of conventional semiconductors.
