\chapter{Conclusions}

Possibilities for future work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Probe dynamics of $E_{22}$ and phonon sideband using single-channel lock-in amplifier
  \item Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements \cite{murakami2009existence}
  \item Do more investigative work on how dielectric constant of SWCNT environment affects carrier dynamics probed by time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements 
\end{itemize}
