\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

We observed clear signature of optical Stark effect in (6,5) SWCNTs. Fast carrier relaxation makes SWCNTs suitable for ultrafast all-optical switching applications based on this phenomenon.

Observed clear exciton quenching in DOC-suspended sample but not in polymer-wrapped sample. Possible that the difference in dielectric environment may have an effect on the upper limit of excitons that can be created. More work needs to be done here to address this key question.

Possibilities for future work:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Probe dynamics of $E_{22}$ and phonon sideband using single-channel lock-in amplifier
  \item Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements \cite{murakami2009existence}
  \item Do more investigative work on how dielectric constant of SWCNT environment affects carrier dynamics probed by time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption measurements
\end{itemize}
