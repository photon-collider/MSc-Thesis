\chapter{Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics of (6,5) SWCNTs After Resonant E$_{22}$ Pumping}

\section{Overview}

This chapter presents an investigation of exciton-exciton annihilation in (6,5)-enriched suspensions using optical-pump, white-light probe measurements. The samples studied include one suspension of (6,5)-enriched SWCNTs dispersed using sodium deoxycholate (DOC) in an aqeuous solution and another and another set of polymer-wrapped (6,5)-enriched SWCNTs dispersed in toluene. All measurements were taken with optical pump photon energy equaling that of the $E_{22}$ resonance at 2.17 eV. Moreover, the measurements were conducted at room temperature under ambient conditions.

For the DOC-suspended sample, the aqueous solution slowly evaporated over time due to a crack in the quartz cuvette containing the dispersion. As a result, the concentration of SWCNTs steadily increased over time leading to an overall increase in optical absorption. This was accounted for by measuring the sample attenuance before each experiment to normalize the experimental data to ensure the consistency of the date. The PFO-wrapped sample was well sealed and no significant changes in the sample absorption were observed over time.


\section{Experimental Results}
Figures \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_time_traces} - \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_normalized_dt} present the data obtained from the DOC-suspended sample. Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_time_traces} shows the normalized attenuance of the sample at indicated time delays using a pump power density of 7.82 GW/cm$^2$. Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_max_decay} shows the maximum decay of the total attenuance within the spectral region of the $E_{11}$ resonance. Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_max_decay_fit} shows the peak attenuance obtained in Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_max_decay} as a function of the power density of the optical pump. Below power densities of 7.82 GW/cm$^2$, the peak attenuance decreases linearly with the power density. Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_normalized_dt} shows the normalized differential transmission curves measured at the labeled power densities. The curves were fit using a bi-exponential decay model. Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_decay_const} shows the fast and slow decay constants extracted from the fits shown in Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_normalized_dt} (a).

Figure \ref{fig:jan_cnt_time_traces} shows the normalized attenuance of the sample at indicated time delays using a pump power density of 7.82 GW/cm$^2$. Figure \ref{fig:jan_cnt_max_decay} shows the maximum decay of the total attenuance within the spectral region of the $E_{11}$ resonance. Figure \ref{fig:jan_cnt_max_decay_fit} shows the peak attenuance obtained in Figure \ref{fig:jan_cnt_max_decay} as a function of the power density of the optical pump. Below power densities of 1.9 GW/cm$^2$, the peak attenuance decreases linearly with the power density. Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_normalized_dt} shows the normalized differential transmission curves measured at the labeled power densities. The curves were fit using a bi-exponential decay model.

\section{Discussion}

Figures \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_time_traces} (DOC-Suspended Sample) and \ref{fig:jan_cnt_time_traces} (Polymer-Wrapped Sample) show a very fast response occuring at the $E_{11}$ resonance shortly after resonantly exciting the $E_{22}$ transition. It appears that $E_{22}$ excitons created quickly decay to form $E_{11}$ excitons. This observation agrees with work of Manzoni et al (2005) who observed that inter-subband relaxation occurs on a femtosecond timescale.

{\color{red} UNFINISHED} The two figures also do show some key differences. In Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_time_traces}, the $E_{11}$ peak broadens and blueshifts. This is typically interpreted as an indication of exciton-exciton screening \cite{shah1996ultrafast}. In the presence of a large population of excitons, the Coulomb interactions between electrons and holes become screened. This leads to a reduced binding energy and broadening of $E_{11}$ peak due to the lower stability of excitons. These results differ from the observations by Ostojic et al.\ (2005) as well as Murakami and Kono (2009) who did not observe any change in the positions and linewidths of the optical resonances in their samples.

If exciton-exciton annihilation were indeed efficient, then the significant photo-bleaching of the optical resonances in SWCNTs should not at all be possible as mentioned by Murakami and Kono (2009). Furthermore, the strong attenuation of oscillator strength of the $E_{11}$ peak may suggest that the density of photo-generated excitons exceeds the Mott density of the system. Excitons, being composed of two half-integer spin quasiparticles, are expected to behave as bosons \cite{Ashcroft, laikhtman2007excitons}. Hence, there should not be photo-bleaching of resonance if only excitons are created by the optical pump. The results here suggest that Fermions also play a role in the observed carrier dynamics.

Unlike Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_time_traces}, Figure \ref{fig:jan_cnt_time_traces} instead shows a narrowing of the $E_{11}$ resonance, especially on the lower energy region of the $E_{11}$ resonance. This could be a sign of spectral-hole burning. Here, the $E_{11}$ peak is inhomogenously broadened as the dispersion contains an ensemble of (6,5) SWCNTs. As a result the homogenous optical resonances, emerging from individual nanotubes, in the lower energy region of the $E_{11}$ resonance will be the first to become photo-bleached.

Figures \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_max_decay}  (DOC-Suspended Sample) and \ref{fig:jan_cnt_max_decay} (Polymer-Wrapped Sample) show the decay of the $E_{11}$ peak as the power density of the optical pump is increased. In the case of Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_max_decay}, the $E_{11}$ peak almost completely disappears, whereas in Figure \ref{fig:jan_cnt_max_decay}, the limited data does seem to indicate saturation behavior as the change from 2.9 to 6.7 GW/cm$^2$ is almost negligible when compared to the change from 1.9 to 2.6 GW/cm$^2$. The maximum attenuances from these figures are plotted in Figures \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_max_decay_fit} and \ref{fig:jan_cnt_max_decay_fit} respectively. Both figures show that the oscillator strength of the $E_{11}$ peak decreases as the pump intensity increases. Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_max_decay_fit} shows a linear decrease that occurs up until a power density of 7.8 GW/cm$^2$. After that point, the decrease in the attenuance begins to saturate. Due to the limited data collected in Figure \ref{fig:jan_cnt_max_decay_fit} it is more difficult to conclude whether saturation does occur. However, the decrease in the attenuance appears to be somewhat linear as shown by the linear fit to the data.

The changes in differential transmission recorded at the $E_{11}$ resonance do not corroborate the previously reported evidence of efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. Figures \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_normalized_dt} (DOC-Suspended Sample) and \ref{fig:jan_cnt_max_normalized_dt} (Polymer-Wrapped Sample) demonstrate this. In Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_normalized_dt}(a), DOC suspension sample showed carrier dynamics that agree with a bi-exponential fit whereas, those of polymer-wrapped sample shown in Figure \ref{fig:jan_cnt_max_normalized_dt} instead correspond to exponential decays. This suggests that carrier relaxation in the polymer-wrapped sample occurs more slowly. Overall, the normalized differential transmission data measured at the indicated power densities closely overlap one another and a fast initial decay does not dominate the observed dynamics at higher power densities.

Furthermore, the scenario presented by dominant exciton-exciton annihilation processes suggests that the initial decay should become faster with increasing power density. The decay constants extracted from the differential transmission data do not exhibit such a trend. Figures \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_decay_const} and \ref{fig:jan_cnt_decay_const} show the extracted decay constants obtained by fitting to the differential transmission measured in each sample respectively. In Figure \ref{fig:weilu_cnt_decay_const}(a), the fast decay constant increases linearly with the power density, whereas in Figure \ref{fig:jan_cnt_decay_const} the decay time does not change significantly.


\section{Conclusions}

For both samples, the data thus far do not appear to show signs of efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. This agrees with the observation of other works measuring the transient aborption of SWCNTs \cite{ostojic2004interband, manzoni2005intersubband, luer2009size}. In the measurements taken here, the dominance of a fast exponential is rather weak and does not appropriately scale with the fluence of the optical pump as expected by time-resolved photoluminenscence measurements.
