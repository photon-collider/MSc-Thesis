\chapter{Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics of (6,5) After Resonant E$_{22}$ Pumping}

\section{Overview}

E22 resonant pump. Spot sizes were . Room temperature, ambient conditions. Dispersion slowly evaporated over time. Normalized data to account for this effect.

\section{Experimental Results}

Photo-bleaching of the $E_{11}$ resonance appears to saturate above a power density of 8 GW/cm$^2$. The right-hand plot shows that below power densities of 8 GW/cm$^2$, the decay of the $E_{11}$ peak is linearly proportional to the power density.}

\subsection{PFO-Wrapped (6,5)-Enriched Dispersion}

E11 broadens and blueshifts slightly. In data with better signal-to-noise ratio, also observe absorption bleaching of phonon sideband.

Only probing bright excitons.

\section{Discussion}

Exciton-Exciton annihilation supposedly efficient \cite{murakami2009existence}. If this is the case, E11 should not be absorption bleached.
